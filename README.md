# Replacing-Motherboard
-in this project i will show how to replace a Motherboard in a laptop

 

Today I will show you how to replace a motherboard in a <b>Dell XPS  9550 ‘15’inch. This laptop I found online on eBay for 120$, the description reads that it has a bad motherboard, and will not boot up, and has no OS and has no RAM.</b>

What you would need for this Project 
•	An electronic tool Kit, (they are not that expensive)<br><b>
•	Another Motherboard that matches the model of the laptop<br>
•	RAM either 8Gb,16GB,32GB <br>
•	Storage M.2 or HDD this model can have both or one.<br>
•	A new Battery either her a 52Wh or 82Wh, you only have room for a M.2 slot based on the size of the battery.<br></b>

So now that we have everything we need, we would need to begin to take the screws off the bottom of the laptop

And, under the XPS flap is two screws.

Let’s take a look inside this casing of the Model, let me explain what we are looking at.

1.	Wi-Fi card<b>

10.  GPU GTX 9550
11. CPU core i5 6300HQ with 4 cores</b>

You also want to change the thermal paste and just clean it with 70% isopropyl alcohol, to make there is no residue left then you can go to BestBuy or any other retail store.

You can look can look up this information about this mother board <b>Intel® Core™ i5-6300HQ Processor </b>
Now we can install the new motherboard on our laptop. I bought it on eBay for like 70$ without the GPU.

If want to buy one with the GPU it is going to be a little bit more expensive, depending on what type of task you are going to be using this computer for, like gaming or video editing or if you are running a program that is using a lot or resource.

This is the board that I got a Core i5 6440HQ.
 

 
Now that we install the board into the laptop now, we put everything back together to make sure everything is connected like the battery, all the ribbon cable that was detached.
